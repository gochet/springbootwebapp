Downloaded yesterday as a way to sharpen my skills.  Took me all day yesterday, and most of today to figure out why it wouldn't build or run.
Turns out, it was trying to use a postgresql DB instead of H2, which resides in-memory, and is simple and useful for testing.  So problem number One solved.
I believe that tomorrow, I will try to implement Postgresql and see what happens.
